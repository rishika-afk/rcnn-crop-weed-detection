# RCNN Optimization Project

## Project Description

This project focuses on optimizing the performance of an RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model for object detection tasks. Leveraging advanced optimization techniques such as Bayesian Optimization and Crow Search Optimization (CSO), the aim is to fine-tune hyperparameters and enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency in detecting objects within images. The project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, providing a diverse collection of annotated images for training and testing the RCNN model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and comprises a diverse collection of annotated images suitable for training and evaluating object detection models. It provides a rich variety of objects in different settings, enabling comprehensive training and testing of the RCNN model.
